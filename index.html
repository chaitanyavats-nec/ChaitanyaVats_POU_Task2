      <h2>Freedom of Choice and Expression:</h2>
      <p>There is an illusion of choice, or even a disregard of it. There is no active participation of people in the story, as they believe that the Multivac is taking their choice into consideration. However, with the lack of transparency, there is no way to ascertain that.</p>
      <h2>Accountability</h2>
      <p>The responsibility of decision making must be borne by the ones making it. But as seen by the concerns of Norman Muller, it is not so.</p>
      <p>The MacComber vote suggests that the voter was blamed for the election instead of the Multivac.</p>

      <h2>Rule of Law</h2>
      <p><em>Now, we don't question the Multivac, do we?</em></p>
      <p>Phil Handley and his colleagues are indicated to practice a lot of unchecked authority in the name of Multivac.</p>
      <p><em>“Mr. Muller can’t leave the house any more until the election day.”</em></p>
      <p><em>“I’m sorry, but that’s the way we must operate.”</em></p>
      <p>Democratic structures are built so that each decision may be scrutinised and questioned</p>
      <p><b>In Democracy, everyone is subject to Law, including those who govern.</b></p>

      <h2>Majority Rule and Minority Rights:</h2>
      <p><em>"The responsibility is too great. I couldn’t face it," </em></p>
      <p>The concept of a majority is irrelevant as the decision is centralized through Multivac and its chosen representative. Norman's apprehension indicates the weight of making a decision for the majority without their consent or input, which undermines minority protections.</p>
      <p><em>"You have no choice, you know. You Must."</em></p>
      <p><b>In Democracy: The majority's decision prevails, but the rights of the minority are protected.</b></p>
      <p><em>"You have no choice, you know. You must."</em></p>

      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p>An intentional lack of information surrounds the existence of Multivac. The most jarring of all is how it collects trillions of items of data about the people.</p>
      <h2>Technocracy</h2>
      <p>There exists a technical barrier for someone to communicate with the Multivac. This reduces the Sovereignity of people as technicians are needed to interpret the outputs of multivac</p>
